# 4. Checkout

This week, let’s implement the code for a supermarket checkout that calculates the total price of a number of items. In a normal supermarket, things are identified using Stock Keeping Units, or SKUs. In our store, we’ll use individual letters of the alphabet (A, B, C, and so on). Our goods are priced individually. In addition, some items are multipriced: buy n of them, and they’ll cost you y cents. For example, item ‘A’ might cost 50 cents individually, but this week we have a special offer: buy three ‘A’s and they’ll cost you $1.30. In fact this week’s prices are:

```
   Item   Unit      Special
         Price     Price
  --------------------------
    A     50       3 for 130
    B     30       2 for 45
    C     20
    D     15
    E     75       2 for 120
    F     20
    G     10
```

## Task

You need to `scan` the following input and give us 2 things in the result: the total to pay, and total savings:

`AAABCFGABBFGADDDCA`

* Try to use [Agents](https://elixirschool.com/en/lessons/advanced/concurrency/#agents) for your implementation
* Start with processing and storing the list first, worry about the item prices later

### Extra mile

* Keep a running total while scanning the items
* Do the total, and calculate the total savings as well!
